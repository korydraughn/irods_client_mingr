# Minimal iRODS Web Application

An experimental web GUI for iRODS built on top of the iRODS HTTP API.

The goals of the project are:
- Provide a simple GUI for non-admin users who aren't comfortable at the command line
- Provide a small application that's easy to modify
- Provide enough functionality for users to get work done
- **Stay as minimal as possible - no unnecessary features, libraries, etc.**
- **Become the most stable GUI for iRODS**
